* Unit Tests work
* Tried to create a first tests with multiple contract (...HollisticTest.js) but Chad can't get it to work
* Contracts now fully functional except Random Arbitrator selection
* Might have to make voting obligatory / remove reputation if someone doesnt vote to avoid people not wanting to vote on ambiguous contracts -- but complicated since sometimes just 50% of the arbitrators have to vote to resolve the dispute


Next steps

* Question about how arbitrators get the necessary info to cast a vote
* How should we decide when a vote ends and who participates? -- Randomized arbitrator selection not working, should arbitrators declare their interest in a vote?, low reputation only for small contracts and vice versa for large contracts, are deadlines possible?,

* Implement Milestones?
