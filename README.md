* Unit Tests work
* Tried to create a first tests with multiple contract (...HollisticTest.js) but Chad can't get it to work
* Contracts now fully functional except Random Arbitrator selection
* Might have to make voting obligatory / remove reputation if someone doesnt vote to avoid people not wanting to vote on ambiguous contracts -- but complicated since sometimes just 50% of the arbitrators have to vote to resolve the dispute


Additonal
* Implement Milestones
